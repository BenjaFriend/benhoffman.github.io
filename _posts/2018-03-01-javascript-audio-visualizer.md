For a recent class project, I had to make an audio visualizer using JavaScript with a canvas. I think that it looks pretty cool, and I am proud of how it turned out.

This was a really interesting project, and it was a ton of fun to make! I would really recommend doing this if you are into JavaScript and wanna make something cool.
