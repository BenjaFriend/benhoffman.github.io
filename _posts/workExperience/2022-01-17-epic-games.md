<p>I started out at Epic as an intern in 2019 and converted to full time in January of 2020. I'm an Engine Programmer on the UE Gameplay Systems team.</p>

<p>As with most people here at Epic, I have a wide range of feature ownership. Some bigger focuses of mine include the
<a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/ProgrammingAndScripting/Blueprints/TechnicalGuide/Compiler/" target="_blank">blueprint editor and compiler</a>, <a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/ProgrammingAndScripting/ProgrammingWithCPP/UnrealArchitecture/Actors/Components/" target="_blank">the component tree</a>, and most recently the <a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.26/en-US/InteractiveExperiences/Input/EnhancedInput/" target="_blank">Enhanced Input Plugin</a>.</p>

<p>I really love the work that I do at Epic because it has such a large potential impact. I have the oppurtunity to improve not only the lives of people at Epic, but also everyone who uses Unreal Engine. </p>
