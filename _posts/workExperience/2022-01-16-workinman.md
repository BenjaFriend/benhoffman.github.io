During my time at Workinman I was guided by senior developers, designers, and artists to create a web based game for one of the companies clients. Some of the features that I implemented in <i>Spongebob's Next Big Adventure</i> include a questing system,  inventory system, and narrative content. This experience exposed me to the full game development pipeline in a challenging and fast paced team environment.
