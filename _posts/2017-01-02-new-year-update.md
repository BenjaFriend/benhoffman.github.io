Over this winter break I have heard back about a Co-Op for this coming Spring semester. It is not 100% set up as of right now, but I have been notified that I will be getting an official offer letter this week. The Co-Op is actually for the Interactive Games and Media and Computer Security departments at RIT. I am tasked with finding a good way to visualize data for pen-testing and other csec(computer security) competitions, like <a href="http://cptc.csec.rit.edu/" target="_blank">CPTC</a>. I think that this is very exciting not only from a visualization standpoint, but also the challenge of actually collecting and sorting the data that I need in real time for this project. I am super excited to get started with this!!

Other then hearing about that Co-Op, I have been continuing to work with Unity on my _[Ship Shooter](http://benhoffman.tech/index.php/2016/12/19/ship-shooter-1-4/)_ game. Some of the bigger progressive things that I have done on that subject are use Unity Services and set up Google Play achievements. I feel that this project has provided me with valuable experience that I could not get anywhere other then pushing myself to learn it.  You can read more about those updates and things [here](http://benhoffman.tech/index.php/2016/12/19/ship-shooter-1-4/).

And of course, Steam sales. So. Many. Games. So far I have picked up a couple party games like <a href="http://phlcollective.com/" target="_blank">PHLCollective</a>&#8216;s _ClusterPuck99 _and _Gang Beasts. _On the AAA front I have been playing a lot of _Titanfall 2_ and I am really loving the multiplayer. I really wish that EA didn&#8217;t release that game so close to _Battlefield 1_ because it really is a multiplayer gem, and it&#8217;s a shame that more people don&#8217;t play it. I have also been putting a little bit of time into _Inside_ and _Abzu. _So far my winter break has been pretty well rounded.

Thanks for reading, and if you want to get in contact with me just head over to my [contact](http://benhoffman.tech/index.php/resume/) page.

Happy New Year!!
