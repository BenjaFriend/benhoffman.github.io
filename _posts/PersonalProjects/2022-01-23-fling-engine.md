Fling Engine is a cross platform Vulkan game engine with a focus on data oriented design. This project is intended to be my playground for learning Vulkan while experimenting with some engine architecture.

I am really proud of what myself and my team were able to accomplish in such a short period of time with this project. It remains my favorite project from when I was in college because I learned so much from it. Doing everything from setting up continuous integration to cross platform graphics programming made for a huge leap in my personal skill development as a programmer. 

To be honest, this project has kind of fallen by the wayside after I started my job at Epic. Doing engine programming as a day job has made it tough to do even more on the weekends and in free time. I really want to pick back up on this in 2022 and work more around creating a simple modular gameplay interface as well as some editor tooling.
