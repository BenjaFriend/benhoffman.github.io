So after countless hours of searching for game jams or related clubs at RIT, I couldn&#8217;t come up with anything. So, I am in the works of creating club called the RIT Game Development Club.

The club will meet up every week, give a theme for a jam, and then later that week or next week we will critique and give feedback on everyone&#8217;s games!

This club also serves the purpose of becoming a creative, innovative, and friendly environment for people to learn and express themselves through game development. If you have a personal project, then bring it in and get some feedback on it! We would be happy to set a time for play tests or demos.
