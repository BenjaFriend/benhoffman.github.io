Today I found out that the game I worked on over the summer at <a href="https://workinman.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Workinman Interactive LLC</a> was published by <a href="http://www.nick.com/spongebob-squarepants/games/spongebobs-next-big-adventure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nickelodeon</a>! You can play it <a href="http://www.nick.com/spongebob-squarepants/games/spongebobs-next-big-adventure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here!</a>

For this project I worked under designer and programmer Devin Strehle to make the systems for quests, inventory, and careers. I also put the main quest lines in place with dialogue and world items. This project was a flash port into a whole new engine, built on the programming side from the ground up for HTML 5.

This is my first &#8220;shipped&#8221; title that I have and it is very exciting for me! Hopefully the first of many more to come.

Thanks!
