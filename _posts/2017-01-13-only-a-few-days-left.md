There are only a few days left until I start my co-op at RIT! I amÂ very excited about my position this semester. Here are the basics, instead of taking any classes, I will be working under the Interactive Games and Media department and the Computer Security department at RIT. This is a full time position for this entire semester.

My objective is create a couple prototypes for a visualization of network data for the CCDC and CPTC competitions in March. I have a lot of freedom and flexibility with this project, which is the main reason why I am so excited about it. My current plan is to use the Elastic Stack to analyze the data that I want, and then send it over the web in JSON format to a Unity application that will then visualize the data.

I don&#8217;t want to get too bogged down in the details, but that is what I am doing this semester. Hopefully I can get some demo of this up and running for the competition this March. There will be a lot of new things to learn on the Linux and networking side of things, and also on the Unity side. Hopefully I can make something that&#8217;s really cool!
