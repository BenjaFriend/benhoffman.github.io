  <h1>Ben Hoffman</h1>
  <p>
    Hey! I'm Ben Hoffman, a current student at the Rochester Institute of Technology.
    I have always had a passion for video games, so I decided to make a career out of
    them. I love learning new things and seeing how they apply to gaming.
  </p>

  <p>
    One of the biggest reasons I love game development is because I am always
    seeking to be challenged with the work that I do, and because the games
    industry moves so fast, I think it is the perfect place for me to be.
  </p>

  <p>
    Currently I am seeking an engineering position with specific interest in C/C++.
