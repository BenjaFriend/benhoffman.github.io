This is my personal website hosted at [benhoffman.tech](https://benhoffman.tech/), nothing too fancy. 

## Getting Started writting Posts

# Running a server locally

I've setup a docker file which will run the jekyll web server on `localhost:4000`. You can
run it with the following commands: 

```console
docker-compose up
```

All done!

# Writing Posts

To add a new post, add to the `_posts` folder in whatever category you would like your post to be on. `PersonalProjects` and `workExperience` are both loaded on the `index.html` home page and are to 
be used for displaying info about my work. `blog` is a place for miscellaneous blog posts that I may write 
about random stuff, not necessarilly work related.

Good luck future Ben!
